🎬 Movie Ticket Booking System
Goal:

Design and implement RESTful APIs for a movie ticket booking system that allows admins to manage movies, theatres, screens, and shows, and enables users to browse, select seats, and book tickets. The system should include authentication and role-based access control.

Requirements Overview
Authentication & Authorization
Implement JWT-based authentication.
Two roles:
Admin: Full access to theatre, movie, and show management.
User: Can browse and book tickets.
Protect endpoints based on roles:
Admin-only routes (prefixed with /admin) should be accessible only to admins.
User routes should be accessible only to authenticated users.
Admin Capabilities
Admins should be able to:

Create, update, and delete theatres.
Add multiple screens under each theatre.
Define seats for each screen (e.g., A1–A10, B1–B10).
Create, update, and delete movies.
Schedule shows by assigning a movie to a specific screen with date, time, and price.
View all user bookings for management and analytics.
User Capabilities
Users should be able to:

Register and log in.
View available movies and shows.
View theatre and screen details with seat layout.
Check seat availability for a selected showtime.
Select specific seats and book tickets.
View their booking history and details.
Cancel their bookings (if allowed by policy).
Schema Design
You need to design an appropriate database schema to support:

Theatres with multiple screens
Screens with defined seat structures
Shows mapped to specific screens and movies
Bookings tied to specific seats and showtimes
Role-based user management (Admin/User)

Expected Deliverables

Proper schema design to handle theatres, screens, seats, movies, shows, and bookings.
Authentication middleware to verify JWT tokens.
Validation for booking (e.g., seat availability, double booking prevention).
